# KPIs 
1) Profit Margin by Dish
This is the most critical KPI in the project, as this is the profit of the owners and the aim of the restaurant is to grow the profit margin so more money will be created than the amount was originaly invested in. 
**(Price per Dish - Cost of Ingredients) / Total Revenue.**
By identifing dishes driving loss or weak profit margin allows the business owners to pivot the menu toward items that actually grow the bank account

2) Customer satisfaction especialy on the dietry and health mesures
The analysis contributes to visualy see what diet our menu cater for, which one is popular from them so every guest can leave satisfied that they found what they wanted on the menu of the restaurant

3) Maximasing menu nitrition
As in the enriched data we get multiple nutritional information of the dishes and health scores it gives the owners a chance to actually see how nutritious their menu is and alter it to the most optimaly balanced meals in each category

4) Most desired cusine or dish category
As a new family restaurant it is hard to find the unique or most popular value it can give to it's customers. In the project it is possible to see how the popularity changes from cusine to cusine and category to category
