At the end of November the ownes decided to change the menu but they wanted to change it in a datadriven way and build a datapipelin so future changes to the menu will automaticly update and they can repate it to the everchanging preferences and trends to the eating habits of the people. 

After the initial set up, and with the first insights they come up with the new menu for December and they perform some analyses on that too so they can make it even better.
